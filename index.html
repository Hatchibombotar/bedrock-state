        Bedrock is in shambles - its an absolute mess, and EVERYONE is in some way, shape, or form affected by the
        developers and microsoft's brazen, careless decisions with how they handle the game and time releases. Every new
        update since 1.13 has been awful for stability and performance. Bedrock edition used to be truly incredible, it
        was something we could brag about for its amazing multiplayer compatibility, accessibility, and buttery smooth
        performance. Now, we certainly do not have that. Just to name a few examples:
      </p>
      <strong> 1.13: lag introduced, this is where performance started to really tank </strong>
      <br>
      <strong> 1.14: lots of random crashes</strong>
      <br>
      <strong> Most of 1.16: critical chunk errors, mobs remaining in memory, pending ticks</strong>
      <br>
      <strong> 1.16.10: exploit that shall not be named</strong>
      <br>
      <strong> 1.16.20: constant crashing for switch, literally unplayable</strong>
      <br>
      <strong> 1.16.100: unbearable mob lag and random TPS drops, supposed to be an addon creator update but instead
        half the
        components were broken or bugged in some way</strong>
      <br>
      <strong> 1.16.200: extremely laggy UI, 500ms input lag, overall biggest performance drop of any version.
        Performance of
        current version of java edition with certain performance mods now rivals or even beats bedrock
        edition.</strong>
      <br>
      <p>

        The developers keep rushing updates and miraculously missing blatantly obvious and in-your-face bugs that
        severely impact gameplay and addon development. 4J studios never did this, and they did an amazing job
        developing the xbox and ps4 counterparts of the game. People STILL play those versions of the game to this day
        because of how smooth and reliable it is. Playing basic survival in bedrock simply isn't reliable anymore,
        your
        chunks could get corrupted at any instant, or a crash that causes a massive rollback.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's next for bedrock now? Based on the current trend of the game and how the developers have been handing
        releases, the future looks really grim. Bedrock no longer can claim that it has optimized performance, is
        riddled with bugs, and lets not forget the extremely controversial, authoritative, and arguably invasive
        permanent ban system. Bedrock is going to die if things continue, many people I know have moved on or switched
        to java because they just don't want to deal with this laughing stock of a game. There needs to be a SERIOUS
        reform of the bedrock executive and development team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on observations, its fair to say that people play on bedrock because they have no other option, and
        given the choice, most who are aware of how amazing the java edition is would switch in a heartbeat if they
        hypothetically could. Mojang. Treat bedrock with the same care you have for java or as old versions of bedrock
        received. More and
        more people are breaking away from this game because of what you all have done to it. <strong> Mojang is doing a
          massive
          disservice for Bedrock edition and it must not continue.</strong> </p>
